Preliminary results on research project towards a quantitative MRI method to measure brain oxygenation. Quantitative BOLD technique effectively evaluates the tissue hemodynamic parameters (e.g. OEF), and its response to a vasodilation challenge in a reliable manner with induced tissue perfusion changes.
