This study uses Monte Carlo simulations to understand the behavior of quantitative BOLD in different physiological conditions, using a Variational Bayesian inference framework with prior information and data from Asymmetric Spin Echo (ASE) scans. In vivo data showed that this inference approach effectively enables smoother and quantitatively different parameter maps of OEF and DBV.
