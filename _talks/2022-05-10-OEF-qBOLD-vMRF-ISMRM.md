Preliminary results on comparision between two quantitative MRI techniques in quantification of brain oxygenation in different gas conditions.

We compared two approaches of quantitative Blood-Oxygenation Level-Dependent (qBOLD) and vascular MR Fingerprinting (vMRF) to map brain oxygenation from Gradient-Echo Sampling of Free Induction Decay and Echo (GESFIDE) scans acquired during normoxic, hyperoxic, and hypoxic gas breathing conditions. In 12 healthy subjects, OEF calculated from qBOLD (qOEF) and OEF generated from vMRF (vOEF) were inversely correlated to pulse oxygenation (SaO2) (p=0.032 and p=0.014, respectively), indicating that qBOLD and vMRF are reliable methods for brain oxygenation mapping.
