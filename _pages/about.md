My name is Linh, and I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California, Davis, supervised by [Professor Audrey Fan](https://fanlab.engineering.ucdavis.edu). My research focuses on developing advanced imaging techniques to study brain function and improve diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. Within this area, I am particularly interested in quantitative methods and application of deep learning in multiple modality imagings. 

I have spent a significant time in the industry as a Neuroimaging Specialist at [Cortechs.ai](https://www.cortechs.ai) (2018-2020). During my undergraduate period, I also worked as a research assistant with [Dr. David Peterson](https://cnc.ucsd.edu) (2018-2020) and a data science research intern at [Prof. Ben Croker's lab](https://www.crokerlab.com/home) (2019).
