My name is Linh, and I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of California, Davis, supervised by [Professor Audrey Fan](https://fanlab.engineering.ucdavis.edu). My research focuses on developing advanced imaging techniques to study brain function and improve diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. Within this area, I am particularly interested in quantitative methods and the application of deep learning in multiple modality imagings. 

Before joining UC Davis, I grew up in Vietnam and finished my high school in England, UK. Then, I moved to America in 2014 to study and received my Bachelor's degree in Science in Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego. During my undergraduate time, I have spent a significant time in the industry as a Neuroimaging Specialist at [Cortechs.ai](https://www.cortechs.ai) (2018-2020), which is a innovating and leading industry in AI-powered imaging biomarkers. During my undergraduate period, I also worked as a research assistant with [Dr. David Peterson](https://cnc.ucsd.edu) (2018-2020) to study about head tremor in cervical dystonia using computer vision. I was a co-author in a paper published [here](hhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X22000132). These experiences inspired me to pursue further to develop a technology to solve the issue of neurodegeneration diseases using advanced imaging techniques.

 Besides, I also involved in a research paper as a data science research intern at [Prof. Ben Croker's lab](https://www.crokerlab.com/home) (2019). You can find more about the paper [here](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/147076)
