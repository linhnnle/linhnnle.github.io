My name is Linh, and I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of California, Davis, supervised by [Professor Audrey Fan](https://fanlab.engineering.ucdavis.edu). My research focuses on developing advanced imaging techniques to study brain function and improve diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. Within this area, I am particularly interested in quantitative methods and the application of deep learning in multiple modality imagings. 

Before joining UC Davis, I grew up in Vietnam and finished my high school in England, UK. Then, I moved to America in 2014 to study and received my Bachelor's degree in Science in Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego. During my undergraduate time, I have spent a significant time in the industry as a Neuroimaging Specialist at [Cortechs.ai](https://www.cortechs.ai), located at San Diego (2018-2020), which is a innovating and leading industry in AI-powered imaging biomarkers. I also worked as a research assistant with [Dr. David Peterson](https://cnc.ucsd.edu) (2018-2020), using computer vision to analyze head tremor and a data science research intern at [Prof. Ben Croker's lab](https://www.crokerlab.com/home) (2019).
